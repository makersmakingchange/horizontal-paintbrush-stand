#  Horizontal Paintbrush Stand
This is a paintbrush stand designed for use by a Mouth Painter. The Horizontal Paintbrush Stand has a series of spaced horizontal slots to rest the brush during use and enable the painter to switch between brushes independently. The stand has a female 1/4"-20 UNC connection for mounting using commercially available camera mounting equipment.
