title: Horizontal Paintbrush Stand
description: The Horizontal Paintbrush Stand is a 3D printable stand that provides an easy
  place to rest paintbrushes. The stand has a series of spaced horizontal slots
  to allow several paintbrushes to be rested and swapped between. The stand has
  a female 1/4"-20 UNC connection on the bottom so the stand can be mounted and
  adjustably positioned using commercially available camera mounting equipment.
intended-use: This is intended for use by artists who use their mouth to paint. The stand
  provides a convenient, easily positionable location for paintbrushes to be
  rested and/or swapped.
